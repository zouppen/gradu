\chapter{Introduction}


The structure of this thesis is following. In chapter
\ref{CHAPTER:EEG} the basics of EEG will be explained. Event-related
potentials (ERP) and their components are introduced in chapter
\ref{CHAPTER:ERP} along with a special case of ERP, mismatch
negativity (MMN). After the basic biomedical concepts the focus will
shift to data analysis methods. Chapter \ref{CHAPTER:LINEAR} takes a
brief look at the more traditional linear time-frequency methods used
in EEG analysis. Empirical mode decomposition and intrinsic mode
functions are discussed in chapter \ref{CHAPTER:EMD}. Theoretical
background behind Hilbert transform and Hilbert spectrum are
introduced in chapter \ref{CHAPTER:HT_HS}.
